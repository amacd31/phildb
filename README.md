# TSDB project
Timeseries database project: For storing potentially changing timeseries data.
For example hydrological data; like streamflow data where the timeseries may be
revised as quality control processes improve the recorded dataset.

TSDB should be capable of storing data at any frequency supported by Pandas.
At this time only daily data has been extensively tested with some limited sub-
daily usage.

## Dependencies
Requires Python 2.7 or greater (mostly tested with Python 2.7 on Mac OSX and Linux).
Test suite status when run with Python 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3 on Ubuntu (using travis):
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amacd31/tsdb.svg?branch=master)

All the python dependencies are recorded in the python\_requirements file.

The virtualenv package can be used to create an isolated install of required Python
packages.

## Installation
Create a virtual environment with dependencies installed:

    make venv

Test everything is working:

    make test

Build the documentation:

    make docs

View the generated documentation at doc/build/html/index.html

For additional details see the INSTALL file.

# Usage
Load virtual environment along with adding TSDB tools to your path:

    . load_env

Create a new TSDB:

    tsdb-create new_tsdb

Open the newly created TSDB:

    tsdb new_tsdb

# Examples
See the examples directory for code on setting up test tsdbs with different data sets.
Each example comes with a README file outlining the steps to acquire some data and load it.
The loading scripts in each example can be used as a basis for preparing a timeseries
database and loading it with data.

The examples/hrs/ example also contains an example script (autocorr.py) for processing the
HRS data using tsdb. The script calculates auto-correlation for all the streamflow timeseries
in the HRS dataset.

Presently there are three sets of example code, acorn-sat, bom\_observations, and hrs.

## ACORN-SAT
Located in examples/acorn-sat this example demonstrates loading minimum and maximum daily
temperature records for 112 stations around Australia.

The dataset used in this example is the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network â€“
Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT) as found on the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website
[ACORN-SAT](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/change/acorn-sat/).

## BOM Observations
Located in examples/bom\_observations this example demonstrates loading half hourly air
temperature data from a 72 hour observations JSON file.

The data used in this example is a 72 hour observations JSON file from the
Australian Bureau of Meteorology website (e.g. JSON file as linked on this page:
[Sydney Airport observations](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDN60901/IDN60901.94767.shtml#other\_formats)

## HRS
Located in examples/hrs this example demonstrates loading daily streamflow data for 221
streamflow stations around Australia.

The dataset used in this example is the Hydrologic Reference Stations (HRS) dataset as found on
the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website [HRS](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/hrs/).


This example also includes a script to calculate the auto-correlation for all the streamflow
timeseries in the HRS dataset.
