The script demonstrating the loading of data is load_acorn_sat_data.py; View
this script for an example on adding timeseries, measurands, and source
to the database before loading timeseries data as timeseries instances.

Ensure you are using the virtual environment and TSDB is on your PATH and PYTHONPATH.
If you haven't already loaded the virtual env:

    cd ../../ && . load_env && cd -

First download Hydrologic Reference Station data from http://www.bom.gov.au/water/hrs:

    tsdb-create acorn_sat

Load ACORN-SAT data into acorn_sat with example script:

    python load_acorn_sat_data.py acorn_sat $(cat data/station_list.txt)
