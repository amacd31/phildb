All commands in this example are relative to this directory.

The script demonstrating the loading of data is load_hrs_data.py; View
this script for an example on adding timeseries, measurand, and source
to the database before loading timeseries data as timeseries instances.

Ensure you are using the virtual environment and TSDB is on your PATH and PYTHONPATH.
If you haven't already loaded the virtual env:
 . ../../load_env

First download Hydrologic Reference Station data from http://www.bom.gov.au/water/hrs:
 cd hrs_data
 sh ./download.sh
 cd ../

Create a new TSDB:
 tsdb-create hrs_db

Load HRS data into hrs_db with example script:
 python load_hrs_data.py hrs_db hrs_data/*.csv

Open the newly created TSDB:
 tsdb hrs_db

Another example script, autocorr.py, shows how access to a TSDB instance
can be automated to perform analysis on the data. This script for example
iterates over all of the available streamflow timeseries instances for the
BOM_HRS dataset and invokes the pandas autocorr function. Stations with
auto-correlation results greater than or equal to 0.95 are then printed.

The script can be run like so:
  python autocorr.py hrs_db

Such analysis could be performed from the interactive tsdb shell as well.
