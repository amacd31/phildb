This project tracks patch provenance and licensing using the
[Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO] and Signed-off-by tags
initially developed by the Linux kernel project.  Because the
documentation for this procedure is licensed under the GPLv2, we have
chosen not to include it in our project directly.  Instead, please see
[SubmittingPatches][], which is stored in an external repository.
